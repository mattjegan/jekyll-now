From Sydney Australia, I am currently interested in web application security and the emerging fields of AI. I am a strong supporter of the open source movement and the push for computer science education in high school education.

### Open Source Work

I am the package maintainer of Rancat, a random generator for names commonly used for databases, project names, etc. I am also the developer behind the HowLong CLI timing tool.
