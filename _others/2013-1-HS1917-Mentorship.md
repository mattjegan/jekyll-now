I actively mentored high school students enrolled in the School of Computer Science and Engineering first year computer science course HS1917 (Formally COMP1917: Introduction to Computing 1) throughout the first semester of 2013 and 2014 while I was a year 12 student and first-year respectively. My role included presenting material based on computer science foundations and the C language as well as being a point of contact for students seeking advice and assistance.
