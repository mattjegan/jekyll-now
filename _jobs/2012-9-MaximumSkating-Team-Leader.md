position: Team Leader
company: Maximum Skating
period: Sep 2012 - Feb 2016

I worked with Maximum Skating for a number of years both as a head crew leader and a rollersports coach specialising in inline speedskating and inline hockey. As part of my roles I sought to provide an excellent customer experience regardless of the customers purpose at the facility. Through my role as an inline hockey coach I was elected as the Skate NSW Head of Officials (Inline Hockey) at the end of 2014. Shortly after accepting this position I was involved as one of two primary organisers for a nationally advertised inline hockey tournament which has ranked as the largest NSW tournament in recent years.
